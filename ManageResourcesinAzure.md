# Manage resources in Azure

## Azure solutions for public, private, and hybrid cloud

Imagine that you work at a healthcare company. You have legacy systems, line-of-business systems, and future plans for new systems. You've heard there are advantages to using cloud computing. How do you choose between public, private, or hybrid cloud environments to support your needs?

## What's cloud computing?
Cloud computing provides services and applications on demand over the internet. Servers, applications, data, and other resources are provided as a service.

To the user, the details of the services are abstracted. You can quickly provision computing resources and use the service with minimal management. You shouldn't think of cloud computing as a datacenter available through the internet. Cloud computing uses virtualization, commodity hardware, and automated processes to provide a self-service user experience to customers, similar to a public utility.

## Public cloud
Public clouds are the most common way to deploy cloud computing. Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. The cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. Services might be free or sold on demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud.

Let's imagine your healthcare company needs an enrollment website. The site needs to scale and be responsive during peak enrollment at various times during the year. Your customers access the site from global locations. You can use the public cloud to automatically scale up to meet demand at peak enrollment. When site traffic is low, your site can scale down to save costs. Your site is responsive at peak demand, and you only pay for more resources when needed. You can also deploy your website in multiple geographic regions to increase reliability and responsiveness.

During your website's development, developers want to create multiple development environments to speed their development process. Developers can use the public cloud to quickly provision virtual machines for sandboxed environments to develop a solution. When the developers no longer need an environment, they can delete it.

## Why public cloud?
Public clouds can be deployed faster than on-premises infrastructures and with an almost infinitely scalable platform. Every employee of a company can use the same application from any office or branch, using their device of choice, as long as they can access the internet.

Examples of why you'd use public cloud:

- Service consumption through on-demand or subscription model: The on-demand or subscription model allows you to pay for the amount of CPU, storage, and other resources that you use or reserve.
- No up-front investment in hardware: No requirement to purchase, manage, and maintain on-premises hardware and application infrastructure. The cloud service provider is held responsible for all management and maintenance of the system.
- Automation: Quickly provision infrastructure resources using a web portal, scripts, or automation.
- Geographic dispersion: Store data near your users or in desired locations without having to maintain your own datacenters.
- Reduced hardware maintenance: The service provider is responsible for hardware maintenance.

## Private cloud
A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. It can be physically located at your organizationâ€™s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. The term private cloud shouldn't be considered a rebranding of traditional on-premises datacenters. A private cloud uses on-premises infrastructure and services to provide similar benefits of the public cloud. It uses an abstraction platform to provide cloud-like services such as Kubernetes clusters, or a complete cloud environment like Azure Stack. The organization is responsible for purchasing, configuring, and maintaining the hardware. Communication between the systems is usually on the network infrastructure that the business owns and maintains; for example, a private internal network or a dedicated fiber-optic connection between buildings.

Imagine you work at a healthcare company and you have an application that's in use at one of your datacenters. The operating environment can't be replicated in the public cloud. You have a new requirement to access data at another one of your datacenters. The database containing the data needs to remain at the other site because of regulatory compliance. This scenario is a private cloud. You have two datacenters your organization owns. You could use a public-cloud VPN over the internet to connect the datacenters. However, the scenario would be considered a private cloud, since the solution is private to the organization.

## Why private cloud?
A private cloud can provide more flexibility to an organization. Your organization can customize its cloud environment to meet specific business needs. Since resources aren't shared with others, high levels of control and security are possible. Also, private clouds can provide a level of scalability and efficiency.

Examples of why you'd use private cloud:

- Pre-existing environment: An existing operating environment that can't be replicated in the public cloud. A large investment in hardware and employees with solution expertise. A large organization can choose to commoditize their computing resources.
- Legacy applications: Business-critical legacy applications that can't easily be physically relocated.
- Data sovereignty and security: Political borders and legal requirements might dictate where data can physically exist.
- Regulatory compliance / certification: PCI or HIPAA compliance. Certified on-premises datacenter.

## Hybrid cloud
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid-cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale their on-premises infrastructure up to the public cloud to handle any overflow without giving third-party datacenters access to the entirety of their data. Organizations gain the flexibility and computing power of the public cloud for basic and nonsensitive computing tasks, while keeping business-critical applications and data on-premises safely behind a company firewall.

Using a hybrid cloud helps eliminate the need to make up-front capital expenditures to handle short-term spikes in demand. It also has the flexibility to manage which resources are local versus resources in the cloud. Companies pay only for resources they temporarily use instead of having to purchase, program, and maintain extra resources and equipment that could remain idle over long periods of time. Integration is generally through a secure VPN between cloud providers like Azure and on-premises datacenters.

Imagine you work at a healthcare company and you have an application where customers can access their healthcare information. A regulation requires that the data needs to remain at a physical location. The customer website needs to be responsive to its many global users. As a solution, the database could be hosted in an on-premises datacenter, and the website could be hosted in the public cloud. You could use a VPN between the on-premises datacenter and the public cloud. This scenario would be considered a hybrid cloud.

## Why hybrid cloud?
A hybrid cloud allows your organization to control and maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets. It also gives you the flexibility to take advantage of extra resources in the public cloud when you need them. With the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed. It can also ease transitioning to the cloud. You can migrate gradually by phasing in workloads over time.

Examples of why you'd use hybrid cloud:

- Existing hardware investment: Business reasons require that you use an existing operating environment and hardware.
- Regulatory requirements: Regulation requires that the data needs to remain at a physical location.
- Unique operating environment: Public cloud can't replicate a legacy operating environment.
- Migration: Move workloads to the cloud over time.

## Cloud service models

Cloud computing resources are delivered using three different service models:

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provides instant computing infrastructure that you can provision and manage over the Internet.
- Platform as a service (PaaS) provides ready-made development and deployment environments that you can use to deliver your own cloud services.
- Software as a service (SaaS) delivers applications over the internet as web-based services.

-----------------------

## Infrastructure as a service

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. IaaS lets you quickly scale resources to meet demand and only pay for what you use. IaaS avoids the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you rent the resource as long as you need it.

As a result, IaaS is flexible. You can provision common infrastructure such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, virtual subnets, firewalls, and VPNs to build a solution. You don't need to manage physical servers and appliances. However, you're responsible for configuring and managing the components; for example, configuring firewalls, updating VM OS's, updating DBMS's, and runtimes.

## Common scenarios
Let's imagine your healthcare company needs to run a special version of desktop software. The software is only supported on a specific version of an operating system, and only one user license is required. You can create a VM with the required software. The user can use a remote desktop connection to connect to the VM to use the software.

Let's imagine another scenario. Your development teams need several unique development environments. Through the development cycle, they need to test various versions of the product. The developers can provision environments when needed. When an environment is no longer needed, your developers can easily delete it.

Some other common scenarios include:

**Website hosting**: If you want more control of hosting a website, running websites using IaaS might be a better option than traditional web hosting.

**Web apps**: IaaS provides all the infrastructure to support web apps, including storage, web and application servers, and networking resources. Organizations can quickly deploy web apps on IaaS and easily scale infrastructure up and down when demand for the apps is unpredictable.

**Storage, backup, and recovery**: Storage management can be complex, requiring a large capital investment and skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS can help simplify planning, management, unpredictable demand, and steadily growing storage needs.

**High-performance computing**: If you have a workload that requires high-performance computing, you can run the workload in the cloud, thus avoiding the up-front cost of the hardware and only paying for the usage when needed.

**Big data analysis**: If you have large datasets that contain potentially valuable patterns, trends, and associations, IaaS can provide the processing power to mine data sets to locate patterns.

## Advantages
Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost: IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting up and managing an on-site datacenter, making it an economical option for start-ups and businesses testing new ideas. As soon as youâ€™ve decided to launch a new product or initiative, the necessary computing infrastructure can be ready in minutes or hours, rather than the days or weeksâ€”and sometimes monthsâ€”it could take to set up internally.

Improves business continuity and disaster recovery: Achieving high availability, business continuity, and disaster recovery is expensive, because it requires a significant amount of technology and staff. With the right service-level agreement (SLA) in place, IaaS can reduce this cost and access applications and data as usual during a disaster or outage.

Respond quicker to shifting business conditions: IaaS lets you quickly scale up resources to accommodate spikes in demand for your applicationâ€”during the holidays, for exampleâ€”then scale resources back down again when activity decreases to save money. Because you donâ€™t need to first set up the infrastructure before you can develop and deliver apps, you can get them to users faster with IaaS.

Increase stability, reliability, and supportability: With IaaS, thereâ€™s no need to maintain and upgrade hardware or troubleshoot equipment problems. With the appropriate agreement in place, the service provider assures that your infrastructure is reliable and meets SLAs.

--------------------------

## Platform as a service

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. With PaaS, you can build and deploy everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure internet connection.

Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking. In addition, it also includes middleware, development tools, and other services. PaaS supports the complete web-application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating. PaaS removes the need to manage software licenses, middleware, and infrastructure of the services. You manage the applications and services you develop, and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.

## Common scenarios
Let's imagine your healthcare company needs a website to describe a product. Your developers want to use PHP. Using PaaS, your developers have the option to create a web app. The infrastructure details such as creating a virtual machine, installing a web server, and installing middleware are abstracted away. You don't need to care on what operating system it runs or what physical hardware is required. Your developers deploy the website files to the cloud, and your website is available on the internet.

Let's imagine another scenario. Your company needs a SQL database to support data analysts for a special project. You don't have infrastructure to accommodate the request. You can quickly provision a SQL Server in the cloud that meets the project's needs. The data analysts can connect to the server. The SQL Server database is provided as a service. Therefore, you don't worry about updates, security patches, or optimizing physical storage for reads and writes.

Some other common scenarios include:

Development framework: PaaS provides a framework upon which developers can build to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high availability, and multitenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers need to do.

Analytics or business intelligence: Analysis tools provided as a service allows you to analyze and mine data. Organizations can find insights and patterns to predict outcomes to improve forecasting, product-design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.

## Advantages
PaaS has similar advantages as IaaS. However, PaaS has extra features, including middleware, development tools, and other business tools, that provide more advantages:

Reduced development time: PaaS development tools can reduce development time for new applications. Developers can use pre-coded application components built into the platform, such as workflow, directory services, security features, and search. PaaS components can give your development team new capabilities without you needing to add staff with the required skills.

Develop for multiple platforms: Some service providers give you development options for multiple platforms, such as desktop, mobile devices, and browsers, making cross-platform apps quicker and easier to develop.

Use sophisticated tools affordably: A pay-as-you-go model makes it possible for individuals or organizations to use sophisticated development software and business intelligence and analytics tools that they couldn't afford to purchase outright.

Support geographically distributed development teams: Because the development environment is accessed over the internet, development teams can work together on projects even when team members are at remote locations.

Efficiently manage the application lifecycle: PaaS provides all of the capabilities that you need to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating within the same integrated environment.

-------------------------------

## Software as a service

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools like Microsoft 365. SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You can rent the use of an application for your organization. Your users connect to the service over the internet, usually with a web browser.

All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service providerâ€™s data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, ensures the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.

If youâ€™ve used a web-based email service such as Outlook, Hotmail, or Yahoo! Mail, then youâ€™ve already used a form of SaaS. With these services, you log into your account over the internet, often from a web browser. The email software is located on the service providerâ€™s network, and your messages are stored there too. You can access your email and stored messages from a web browser on any computer or internet-connected device.

## Common scenarios
Let's imagine your healthcare company requires a customer relationship management (CRM) solution for its sales team. The team is global. You can use a SaaS CRM provider to quickly implement a solution for your organization's sales team.

For organizational use, you can rent productivity apps, such as email, collaboration, and calendaring, and sophisticated business applications such as CRM, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and document management. You pay for the use of these apps by subscription or according to the level of use.

## Advantages
Gain access to sophisticated applications: To provide SaaS apps to users, you donâ€™t need to purchase, install, update, or maintain any hardware, middleware, or software. SaaS makes even sophisticated enterprise applications, such as ERP and CRM, affordable for organizations that lack the resources to buy, deploy, and manage the required infrastructure and software themselves. You pay only for what you use. You also save money, because the SaaS service automatically scales up and down according to the level of usage.

Use free client software: Users can run most SaaS apps directly from their web browser without needing to download and install any software. You don't need to purchase or deploy client software for your users.

Access app data from anywhere: With data stored in the cloud, users can access their information from any internet-connected computer or mobile device. Since app data is stored in the cloud, no data is lost if a userâ€™s computer or device fails.

# What is the Azure CLI?

The Azure CLI is a command-line program to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and allows administrators and developers to execute their commands through a terminal or command-line prompt (or script) instead of a web browser. For example, to restart a virtual machine (VM), you'd use the following command:

```powershell
az vm restart -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm
```
The Azure CLI provides cross-platform command-line tools for managing Azure resources, and you can easily install it locally on Linux, Mac, or Windows computers. You can also use the Azure CLI from a browser through the Azure Cloud Shell. In both cases, you can use it interactively or scripted. For interactive use, you'll first launch a shell (such as cmd.exe on Windows or Bash on Linux or macOS), then issue the command at the shell prompt. To automate repetitive tasks, you'll assemble the CLI commands into a shell script using the script syntax of your chosen shell, then execute the script.

## Using the Azure CLI in scripts
If you want to use the Azure CLI commands in scripts, you need to be aware of any issues around the "shell" (or environment) used for running the script. For example, in a Bash shell, you'll use this syntax when setting variables:

```bash
variable="value"
variable=integer
```
If you use a PowerShell environment for running Azure CLI scripts, you'll use this syntax for variables:
```powershell
$variable="value"
$variable=integer
```

You must install the Azure CLI before you can use it to manage Azure resources from a local computer. The installation steps vary for Windows, Linux, and macOS, but once installed, the commands are common across platforms.

## Work with the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI lets you type commands and execute them immediately from the command line. Recall that the overall goal in the software-development example is to deploy new builds of a web app for testing. Let's talk about the sorts of tasks you can do with the Azure CLI.

## What Azure resources can be managed using the Azure CLI?

The Azure CLI lets you control nearly every aspect of every Azure resource. You can work with resource groups, storage, virtual machines, Microsoft Entra ID, containers, machine learning, and so on.

Commands in the CLI are structured in groups and subgroups. Each group represents a service provided by Azure, and the subgroups divide commands for these services into logical groupings. For example, the `storage` group contains subgroups including account, blob, and queue.

So, how do you find the particular commands you need? One way is to use `az find`, the AI robot that uses the Azure documentation to tell you more about commands, the CLI, and more.

Example: find the most popular commands related to the word blob:

```powershell
az find blob
```

Example: Show me the most popular commands for an Azure CLI command group, such as az vm:

```powershell
az find "az vm"
```

Example: Show me the most popular parameters and subcommands for an Azure CLI command:

```powershell
az find "az vm create"
```

If you already know the name of the command you want, the `--help` argument for that command will get you more detailed information on the command and a list of the available subcommands for a command group. So, with our storage example, here's how you can get a list of the subgroups and commands for managing blob storage:

```powershell
az storage blob --help
```

## How to create an Azure resource

When you're creating a new Azure resource, there are typically three steps: connect to your Azure subscription, create the resource, and verify that creation was successful. The following illustration shows a high-level overview of the process.

## Connect

Because you're working with a local install of the Azure CLI, you'll need to authenticate before you can execute Azure commands by using the Azure CLI login command.

```powershell
az login
```

The Azure CLI will typically launch your default browser to open the Azure sign-in page. If this doesn't work, follow the command-line instructions and enter an authorization code at https://aka.ms/devicelogin.

After successfully signing in, you'll be connected to your Azure subscription.

## Create

You'll often need to create a new resource group before you create a new Azure service, so we'll use resource groups as an example to show how to create Azure resources from the CLI.

The Azure CLI group create command creates a resource group. You must specify a name and location. The name must be unique within your subscription. The location determines where the metadata for your resource group will be stored. You can use strings like "West US," "North Europe," or "West India" to specify the location; alternatively, you can use single-word equivalents, such as westus, northeurope, or westindia. The core syntax is:

```powershell
az group create --name <name> --location <location>
```

## Verify

For many Azure resources, the Azure CLI provides a list subcommand to view resource details. For example, the Azure CLI group list command lists your Azure resource groups. This is useful to verify whether the resource group was successfully created:

```powershell
az group list
```

To get a more concise view, you can format the output as a simple table:

```powershell
az group list --output table
```

-----------------------------

## What are resource groups?

Resource groups are a fundamental element of the Azure platform. A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription, like virtual machines, Application Gateways, and Cosmos DB instances. All resources must be in a resource group, and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group. Many resources can be moved between resource groups, with some services having specific limitations or requirements to move. Resource groups can't be nested. Before you can provision any resource, you need a resource group in which to place it.

## Logical grouping

Resource groups exist to help manage and organize your Azure resources. By placing resources of similar usage, type, or location into resource groups, you can provide some order and organization to resources you create in Azure. Logical grouping is the aspect that you're most interested in here, because there's a lot of disorder among your company's resources.

## Lifecycle

If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within the group are also deleted. Organizing resources by lifecycle can be useful in non-production environments, where you might try an experiment and dispose of it when done. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once.

## Authorization
Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. By applying RBAC permissions to a resource group, you can reduce administration and limit access to allow only what's needed.

## Create a resource group
You can create resource groups by using the following methods:

- Azure portal
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- Templates
- Azure SDKs (like .NET or Java)

## Use resource groups for organization

## Consistent naming convention

You can start with using an understandable naming convention. You named your resource group msftlearn-core-infrastructure-rg. You've given some indication of what it's used for (msftlearn), the types of resources contained within (core-infrastructure), and the type of resource it is (rg). This descriptive name gives us a better idea of what it is. If you had named it my-resource-group or rg1, you'd have no idea on a glance of what the usage may be. In this case, you can deduce that there are probably core pieces of infrastructure contained within. If you created more virtual networks, storage accounts, or other resources that the company might consider core infrastructure, you could also place them here to improve your company's resource organization. Naming conventions can vary widely between and even within companies, but some planning can help.

## Organizing principles
You can organize resource groups in a number of ways; let's take a look at a few examples. You might put all resources that are core infrastructure into this resource group, but you could also organize resources strictly by resource type. For example, you might put all virtual networks in one resource group, all virtual machines in another resource group, and all Azure Cosmos DB instances in another resource group.

## Organize for authorization
Because resource groups are a scope of RBAC, you can organize resources by who needs to administer them. If your database administration team is responsible for managing all of your Azure SQL Database instances, putting them in the same resource group simplifies administration. You could give the team the proper permissions at the resource-group level to administer the databases within the resource group. Similarly, the database administration team could be denied access to the resource group with virtual networks so they don't inadvertently make changes to resources outside their scope of responsibility.

## Organize for lifecycle
We previously described that resource groups serve as the lifecycle for the resources within them. If you delete a resource group, you also delete all the resources in the group. Use this to your advantage, especially in areas where resources are more disposable, like non-production environments. If you deploy 10 servers for a project that you know will only last a couple of months, you might put them all in a single resource group. One resource group is easier to clean up than 10 or more resource groups.

## Organize for billing
Lastly, placing resources in the same resource group is a way to group them for usage in billing reports. If you're trying to understand how your costs are distributed in your Azure environment, grouping them by resource group is one way to filter and sort the data to better understand where costs are allocated.

## Use tagging to organize resources

You've gone through your resources and moved them into resource groups that are more organized than before; but what if resources have multiple uses? How do you better search, filter, and organize these resources? Tags can be helpful as you look to improve organization of your Azure resources.

## What are tags?
Tags are name/value pairs of text data that you can apply to resources and resource groups. Tags allow you to associate custom details about your resource. In addition to the standard Azure properties, a resource has the following properties:

department (like finance, marketing, and more)
environment (prod, test, dev)
cost center
lifecycle and automation (like shutdown and startup of virtual machines)
A resource can have up to 50 tags. The name value is limited to 512 characters for all types of resources except storage accounts, which have a limit of 128 characters. The tag value is limited to 256 characters for all types of resources. Tags aren't inherited from parent resources. Not all resource types support tags, and you can't apply tags to classic resources.

You can add and manipulate tags through the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, and through the REST API. For example, to add a resource tag to a virtual network using the Azure CLI, you could use the following command:

```powershell
az resource tag --tags Department=Finance --resource-group msftlearn-core-infrastructure-rg --name msftlearn-vnet1 --resource-type "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks"
```

You can use Azure Policy to automatically add or enforce tags for resources your organization creates based on policy conditions that you define. For example, you could require that a value for the Department tag is entered when someone in your organization creates a virtual network in a specific resource group.

--------------------------------------

## Use policies to enforce standards

You're organizing your resources better in resource groups, and you've applied tags to your resources to use them in billing reports and in your monitoring solution. Resource grouping and tagging have made a difference in the existing resources, but how do you ensure that new resources follow the rules? Let's take a look at how policies can help you enforce standards in your Azure environment.

## What is Azure Policy?

Azure Policy is a service you can use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies apply and enforce rules that your resources need to follow. These policies can enforce these rules when resources are created, and you can evaluate them against existing resources to give visibility into compliance.

Policies can enforce rules such as only allowing specific types of resources to be created or only allowing resources in specific Azure regions. You can enforce naming conventions across your Azure environment. You can also enforce that specific tags are applied to resources. Let's take a look at how policies work.

## Create a policy
You'd like to ensure that all resources have the Department tag associated with them and block creation if the tag doesn't exist. You'll need to create a new policy definition and assign it to a scope; in this case, the scope is our msftlearn-core-infrastructure-rg resource group. You can create and assign policies through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. This exercise takes you through creating a policy in the portal.

-------------------------------------

## Secure resources with role-based access control

Implementing Azure Policy ensured that all our employees with Azure access are following our internal standards for creating resources, but we have a second issue we need to solve: how do we protect those resources once they're deployed? We have IT personnel who need to manage settings, developers who need to have read-only access, and administrators who need to be able to control them completely. Enter Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

RBAC provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources, allowing you to grant users the specific rights they need to perform their jobs. RBAC is considered a core service and is included with all subscription levels at no cost.

Using RBAC, you can:

- Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription and another user to manage virtual networks.
- Allow a database administrator (DBA) group to manage SQL databases in a subscription.
- Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as VMs, websites, and virtual subnets.
- Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group.
To view access permissions, use the Access control (IAM) panel for the resource in the Azure portal. On this panel, you can determine who can access an area and their assigned role. Using this same panel, you can also grant or remove access.

## How RBAC defines access
RBAC uses an allow model for access. When you're assigned to a role, RBAC allows you to perform specific actions, such as read, write, or delete. Therefore, if one role assignment grants you read permissions to a resource group, and a different role assignment grants you write permissions to the same resource group, you will have both read and write permissions on that resource group.

## Best Practices for RBAC
Here are some best practices you should use when setting up resources:

- Segregate duties within your team and grant users only the amount of access that they need to perform their jobs. Instead of giving everybody unrestricted permissions in your Azure subscription or resources, allow only specific actions at a particular scope.
- When planning your access control strategy, grant users the lowest privilege level that they need to do their work.
- Use Resource Locks to ensure critical resources aren't modified or deleted (as you'll learn in the next unit).

## Use resource locks to protect resources

In a recent conversation, your manager mentioned that there had been instances where critical Azure resources were mistakenly deleted. Because there was disorganization across their Azure environment, good intentions of cleaning up unnecessary resources resulted in accidental deletions of resources critical to other systems. You've heard of resource locks on Azure. You mention to your manager that you think you can help prevent this type of incident from happening in the future. Let's take a look at how you could use resource locks to solve this problem.

## What are resource locks?
Resource locks are a setting that you can apply to any resource to block modification or deletion. You can set resource locks to either Delete or Read-only. Delete will allow all operations against the resource, but block the ability to delete it. Read-only will only allow read activities to be performed against it, blocking any modification or deletion of the resource. You can apply resource locks to subscriptions, resource groups, and to individual resources. Resource locks are inherited when applied at higher levels.

--------------------------

# Identify incorrectly assigned resources in Azure

## Organize Azure resources into resource groups

You use resource groups to logically group resources together. Each resource must be part of a single resource group. A resource group can hold many different types of resources in different regions.

Generally, resource groups hold resources that are related. For example, you can have a resource group for testing and development, and a separate one for production. A production resource group might hold resources that support a live website. These resources can include several virtual machines (VMs), storage accounts, virtual networks, and Azure SQL Database instances.

Make sure that all the resources in your resource group have a single lifecycle. You want to update, delete, or deploy these resources together. If you believe a resource doesn't fit into the lifecycle of other resources, move it to another resource group.

You can control which resources are available to different types of users. In this way, resource groups help you protect your resources and control costs.

To change the billing assignment for resources in resource groups, you can move resources from one resource group to another resource group in a different subscription. In this case, you need to put any dependent resources into one resource group. Then, move the resources from that resource group into a new resource group in the other subscription.

##  Use a consistent naming convention

To help identify and organize your resource groups, use a consistent naming convention. For example, you might have a resource group named project-infrastructure-resource-group to denote that it's a resource group for a certain project's infrastructure.

## Use tags to find resources
Tags are name and value pairs that you apply to resources. For example, you can set the name environment and its value as development for all resources that aren't meant for production. In this way, you ensure that you can easily find related resources and keep them organized.

# Part 2: Implement resource management security in Azure

## What is Azure RBAC?

When it comes to identity and access, most organizations that are considering using the public cloud are concerned about two things:

- Ensuring that when people leave the organization, they lose access to resources in the cloud.
- Striking the right balance between autonomy and central governance; for example, giving project teams the ability to create and manage virtual machines in the cloud while centrally controlling the networks those VMs use to communicate with other resources.
Microsoft Entra ID and Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) work together to make it simple to carry out these goals.

## Azure subscriptions
First, remember that each Azure subscription is associated with a single Microsoft Entra directory. Users, groups, and applications in that directory can manage resources in the Azure subscription. The subscriptions use Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on (SSO) and access management. You can extend your on-premises Active Directory to the cloud by using **Microsoft Entra Connect**. This feature allows your employees to manage their Azure subscriptions by using their existing work identities. When you disable an on-premises Active Directory account, it __automatically__ loses access to all Azure subscriptions connected with Microsoft Entra ID.

## What's Azure RBAC?
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management for resources in Azure. With Azure RBAC, you can grant the exact access that users need to do their jobs. For example, you can use Azure RBAC to let one employee manage virtual machines in a subscription while another manages SQL databases within the same subscription.

You can grant access by assigning the appropriate Azure role to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope. The scope of a role assignment can be a management group, subscription, a resource group, or a single resource. A role assigned at a parent scope also grants access to the child scopes contained within it. For example, a user with access to a resource group can manage all the resources it contains, like websites, virtual machines, and subnets. The Azure role that you assign dictates what resources the user, group, or application can manage within that scope.

## What can I do with Azure RBAC?
Azure RBAC allows you to grant access to Azure resources that you control. Suppose you need to manage access to resources in Azure for the development, engineering, and marketing teams. Youâ€™ve started to receive access requests, and you need to quickly learn how access management works for Azure resources.

Here are some scenarios you can implement with Azure RBAC:

- Allow one user to manage virtual machines in a subscription and another user to manage virtual networks
- Allow a database administrator group to manage SQL databases in a subscription
- Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as virtual machines, websites, and subnets
- Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group

## How does Azure RBAC work?
You can control access to resources using Azure RBAC by creating role assignments, which control how permissions are enforced. To create a role assignment, you need three elements: a security principal, a role definition, and a scope. You can think of these elements as "who," "what," and "where."

## 1. Security principal (who)
A security principal is just a fancy name for a user, group, or application to which you want to grant access.

## 2. Role definition (what you can do)
A role definition is a collection of permissions. It's sometimes just called a role. A role definition lists the permissions the role can perform, such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be high-level, like Owner, or specific, like Virtual Machine Contributor.

Azure includes several built-in roles that you can use. The following lists four fundamental built-in roles:

- Owner: Has full access to all resources, including the right to delegate access to others
- Contributor: Can create and manage all types of Azure resources, but canâ€™t grant access to others
- Reader: Can view existing Azure resources
- User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources
If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own custom roles.

## 3. Scope (where)
Scope is the level where the access applies. This is helpful if you want to make someone a Website Contributor, but only for one resource group.

In Azure, you can specify a scope at multiple levels: management group, subscription, resource group, or resource. Scopes are structured in a parent-child relationship. When you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by the child scopes. For example, if you assign the Contributor role to a group at the subscription scope, that role is inherited by all resource groups and resources in the subscription.

## Role assignment
Once you have determined the who, what, and where, you can combine those elements to grant access. A role assignment is the process of binding a role to a security principal at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access. To grant access, you'll create a role assignment. To revoke access, you'll remove a role assignment.

## Azure RBAC is an allow model
Azure RBAC is an allow model. This means that when you're assigned a role, Azure RBAC allows you to perform certain actions, such as read, write, or delete. So, if one role assignment grants you read permissions to a resource group and a different role assignment grants you write permissions to the same resource group, you'll have read and write permissions on that resource group.

Azure RBAC has something called `NotActions` permissions. You can use `NotActions` to create a set of not allowed permissions. The access a role grantsâ€”the effective permissionsâ€”is computed by subtracting the `NotActions` operations from the `Actions` operations. For example, the Contributor role has both `Actions` and `NotActions`. The wildcard (*) in `Actions` indicates that it can perform all operations on the control plane. You'd then subtract the following operations in `NotActions` to compute the effective permissions:

- Delete roles and role assignments
- Create roles and role assignments
- Grant the caller User Access Administrator access at the tenant scope
- Create or update any blueprint artifacts
- Delete any blueprint artifacts

---------------------------

# Understand the difference between Azure roles and Microsoft Entra roles

Azure resources and Microsoft Entra ID have independent permission systems. You use Azure roles to manage access to virtual machines, storage, and other Azure resources. You use Microsoft Entra roles to manage access to Microsoft Entra resources, such as user accounts and passwords.

## Azure roles
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is the system that allows control over who has access to which Azure resources and what those people can do with those resources. You can achieve control by assigning roles to users, groups, or applications at a particular scope. A role might be described as a collection of permissions.

With Azure RBAC, you can allow one user or a set of users to access resources in a subscription. You can also separate responsibility for certain resources according to the specializations within your team. For example, you might want to grant your organization's data scientists access to Azure Machine Learning and any associated resources, such as Azure SQL Database, or you might want to grant access to Azure Blob storage within a dedicated Machine Learning resource group. By granting specific access, you isolate these resources from team members who don't have the required skills or resource needs.

You can specify fine-grained permissions for applications so that a marketing web app has access to only the associated marketing database and storage account. For managers or team members who are higher up in the organization, you could grant access to all resources in a resource group, a subscription for management purposes, and an overview of billing and consumption.

Azure RBAC has many built-in roles, and you can create custom roles.

Here are four examples of built-in roles:

- Owner: Has full access to all resources, including the ability to delegate access to other users
- Contributor: Can create and manage Azure resources
- Reader: Can view only existing Azure resources
- User Access Administrator: Can manage access to Azure resources  

## Identify the right scope
You can apply Azure roles at four levels of scope: management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources. The following diagram illustrates the hierarchy of these four levels.

Azure management groups help you manage your Azure subscriptions by grouping them together. If your organization has many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions.

Azure subscriptions help you organize access to Azure resources and determine how resource usage is reported, billed, and paid for. Each subscription can have a different billing and payment setup, so you can have different subscriptions and plans by office, department, project, and so on.

Resource groups are containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. A resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You can decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.

The scope is important, and establishes which resources should have a specific type of access applied to them. Imagine that someone in your organization needs access to virtual machines. You could use the Virtual Machine Contributor role, which allows that person to manage virtual machines only within a specific resource group. You can limit the role's scope to a specific resource, resource group, subscription, or management group level.

By combining an Azure role and a scope, you can set finely tailored permissions for your Azure resources.

## Microsoft Entra roles
Microsoft Entra ID also has its own set of roles that apply mostly to users, passwords, and domains. These roles have different purposes. Here are a few examples:

- Global Administrator: Can manage access to administrative features in Microsoft Entra ID. A person in this role can grant administrator roles to other users, and they can reset a password for any user or administrator. By default, whoever signs up for the directory is automatically assigned this role.

- User Administrator: Can manage all aspects of users and groups, including support tickets, monitoring service health, and resetting passwords for certain types of users.

- Billing Administrator: Can make purchases, manage subscriptions and support tickets, and monitor service health. Azure has detailed billing permissions in addition to Azure RBAC permissions. The available billing permissions depend on the agreement you have with Microsoft.

## Differences between Azure roles and Microsoft Entra roles
The main difference between Azure roles and Microsoft Entra roles is the areas they cover. Azure roles apply to Azure resources, and Microsoft Entra roles apply to Microsoft Entra resources (particularly users, groups, and domains). Also, Microsoft Entra ID has only one scope: the directory. The Azure RBAC scope covers management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.

The roles share a key area of overlap. A Microsoft Entra Global Administrator can elevate their access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups. This greater access grants them the Azure RBAC User Access Administrator role for all subscriptions of their directory. Through the User Access Administrator role, the Global Administrator can give other users access to Azure resources.

In our scenario, you need to grant full Azure RBAC management and billing permissions to a new manager. To achieve this, you'll temporarily elevate your access to include the User Access Administrator role. You can then grant the new manager the Owner role so that they can create and manage resources. You'll also set the scope to the subscription level so that the manager can do this for all resources in the subscription.

The following diagram shows what resources the Global Administrator can view when their permissions are elevated to User Access Administrator.

## Understand when you might need to elevate your access

The marketing department's Azure subscription administrator recently left the organization. As Global Administrator, you don't have access to this subscription. You now need to grant administrator access for the subscription to another person in the marketing department.

## When to elevate access
By default, a Global Administrator doesn't have access to Azure resources. The Global Administrator for Microsoft Entra ID can temporarily elevate their permissions to the Azure role of User Access Administrator. This action grants the Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions they need to manage Azure resources. The User Access Administrator is assigned at the scope of root. The role can view all resources in and assign access to any subscription or management group in that Microsoft Entra organization.

As Global Administrator, you might need to elevate your permissions to:

- Regain lost access to an Azure subscription or management group.
- Grant another user or yourself access to an Azure subscription or management group.
- View all Azure subscriptions or management groups in an organization.
- Grant an automation app access to all Azure subscriptions or management groups.
After the Global Administrator elevates their permissions to User Access Administrator, they can then grant other users the Azure RBAC permissions that they need to control and manage Azure resources. When the task is complete, the Global Administrator should revoke their own elevated permissions.

## Assign a user administrative access to an Azure subscription
To assign a user administrative access to a subscription, you must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` and `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete` permissions at the subscription scope. Users with the subscription Owner or User Access Administrator role have these permissions.

In the next unit, you'll learn how to assign a role by using the Azure portal after you've elevated your permissions to User Access Administrator. However, you can also assign roles by using Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or the REST API.

In the following sections, let's briefly review the commands you would use to assign the Owner role in Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI.

## Assign the role by using Azure PowerShell
The following command shows how to assign the Owner role to a user at the subscription scope by using Azure PowerShell:
```powershell
New-AzRoleAssignment `
    -SignInName rbacuser@example.com `
    -RoleDefinitionName "Owner" `
    -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>"
```
## Assign the role by using the Azure CLI
The following command shows how to assign the Owner role to a user at the subscription scope by using the Azure CLI:
```powershell
az role assignment create --assignee rbacuser@example.com --role "Owner" --scope /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name> --subscription <subscription_name_or_id>
```

# What are custom roles in Azure?

Sometimes, built-in roles don't grant the precise level of access you need. Custom roles allow you to define roles that meet the specific needs of your organization. You can assign the Azure custom roles you create to users, groups, and service principals at the scope of subscription, resource group, or resource.

## Microsoft Entra and Azure roles
Microsoft Entra roles and Azure roles are often confused when you first work with Azure. Microsoft Entra roles provide the mechanism for managing permissions to Microsoft Entra resources, like user accounts and passwords. Azure roles provide a wealth of capabilities for managing Azure resources like virtual machines (VMs) at a granular level.

| Azure roles | Microsoft Entra roles |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Manage access to Azure resources like VMs, storage, networks, and more | Manage access to Microsoft Entra resources like user accounts and passwords |
| Multiple scope levels (management group, subscription, resource group, resource) | Scope only at tenant level |
| Role information accessible through Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, REST API | Role information accessible in Azure admin portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Graph PowerShell |


## Role definition and structure
A custom role definition breaks down into a collection of different permissions. Each definition details the operations that are allowed, such as read, write, and delete. The definition is formed using these structures:

```json
{
  "Name": "",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "",
  "Actions": [],
  "NotActions": [],
  "DataActions": [],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}"
  ]
}
```

The following example shows the role definition for the Contributor role:
```powershell
{
  "Name": "Contributor",
  "Id": "b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c",
  "IsCustom": false,
  "Description": "Lets you manage everything except access to resources.",
  "Actions": [
    "*"
  ],
  "NotActions": [
    "Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete",
    "Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write",
    "Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action",
    "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/write",
    "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/delete"
  ],
  "DataActions": [],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/"
  ]
}
```

Any role definition is declared using the following format:

`{Company}.{ProviderName}/{resourceType}/{action}`

The action portion is typically one of the following actions:

- *
- read
- write
- action
- delete

## Define custom role to manage VMs
To help you identify what permissions to include in a role definition, use the Azure Resource Manager resource provider operations list and look at built-in Azure roles that have permissions similar to what you need.

## Review built-in roles
For our scenario, the Virtual Machine Contributor built-in role has more permissions than the employee needs, and Virtual Machine Administrator Login doesn't have enough.

The following Azure CLI command returns the permissions for the built-in role Virtual Machine Contributor:

```powershell
az role definition list --name "Virtual Machine Contributor" --output json | jq '.[] | .permissions[0].actions'
```

The following list displays the permissions for the built-in role Virtual Machine Contributor:

```json
[
  "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read",
  "Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/*",
  "Microsoft.Compute/locations/*",
  "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/*",
  "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/*",
  "Microsoft.DevTestLab/schedules/*",
  "Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*",
  "Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/backendAddressPools/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/inboundNatPools/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/inboundNatRules/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/probes/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/read",
  "Microsoft.Network/locations/*",
  "Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/*",
  "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/read",
  "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/join/action",
  "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read",
  "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read",
  "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/locations/*",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupFabrics/backupProtectionIntent/write",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupFabrics/protectionContainers/protectedItems/*/read",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupFabrics/protectionContainers/protectedItems/read",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupFabrics/protectionContainers/protectedItems/write",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupPolicies/read",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupPolicies/write",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/read",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/usages/read",
  "Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/write",
  "Microsoft.ResourceHealth/availabilityStatuses/read",
  "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*",
  "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
  "Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine/*",
  "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action",
  "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read",
  "Microsoft.Support/*"
]
```

To get this list in PowerShell, you'd run the following command:
```powershell
Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name "Virtual Machine Contributor" | Select Actions | ConvertTo-Json
```

For our scenario, we want a custom role that allows you to monitor and restart virtual machines for a specific subscription, so we want to include the following actions scoped at the subscription level:

- Read access to the compute, network, and storage resources
- Ability to start and restart virtual machines
- Access to the resource groups in the subscription
- Access to monitoring resources
There are some operations in the Virtual Machine Contributor role definition we can use, like `"Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*"` for monitoring, but restart and some others aren't listed as actions in that role definition.

## Find resource provider operations
We can find the VM restart action in the Azure Resource Manager resource provider operations list or by running the following PowerShell command to return operations for VMs:
```powershell
Get-AzProviderOperation */virtualMachines/*
```

You can use the Azure PowerShell `Get-AzProviderOperation` cmdlet to get the most current list of resource provider operations. In Azure CLI, use the `az provider operation show` command. You can find a published list of resource providers and operations in the Azure RBAC content on Docs.

## Create VM Operator role definition
Let's assume we've picked out what we need by looking at the related built-in role definitions and the resource provider operations list. We end up with the following role definition for our custom role. We'll use this role definition for our custom role.

```json
{
   "Name": "Virtual Machine Operator",
   "Id": "88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888",
   "IsCustom": true,
   "Description": "Can monitor and restart virtual machines.",
   "Actions": [
     "Microsoft.Storage/*/read",
     "Microsoft.Network/*/read",
     "Microsoft.Compute/*/read",
     "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action",
     "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/restart/action",
     "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read",
     "Microsoft.ResourceHealth/availabilityStatuses/read",
     "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
     "Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*",
     "Microsoft.Support/*"
   ],
   "NotActions": [],
   "DataActions": [],
   "NotDataActions": [],
   "AssignableScopes": [
      "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}" 
   ]
   }
```

---------------------------------------

# What are user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID?

In Microsoft Entra ID, all user accounts are granted a set of default permissions. A user's account access consists of the type of user, their role assignments, and their ownership of individual objects.

There are different types of user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID. Each type has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done under each type of user account. Administrators have the highest level of access, followed by the member user accounts in the Microsoft Entra organization. Guest users have the most restricted level of access.

## Permissions and roles
Microsoft Entra ID uses permissions to help you control the access rights a user or group is granted. This is done through roles. Microsoft Entra ID has many roles with different permissions attached to them. When a user is assigned a specific role, they inherit permissions from that role. For example, a user assigned to the User Administrator role can create and delete user accounts.

Understanding when to assign the correct type of role to the right user is a fundamental and crucial step in maintaining privacy and security compliance. If the wrong role is assigned to the wrong user, the permissions that come with that role can allow the user to cause serious damage to an organization.

## Administrator roles
Administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID allow users elevated access to control who is allowed to do what. You assign these roles to a limited group of users to manage identity tasks in a Microsoft Entra organization. You can assign administrator roles that allow a user to create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and more.

If your user account has the User Administrator or Global Administrator role, you can create a new user in Microsoft Entra ID by using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or PowerShell. In PowerShell, run the cmdlet `New-MgUser`. In the Azure CLI, use `az ad user create`.

## Member users
A member user account is a native member of the Microsoft Entra organization that has a set of default permissions like being able to manage their profile information. When someone new joins your organization, they typically have this type of account created for them.

Anyone who isn't a guest user or isn't assigned an administrator role falls into this type. A member user role is meant for users who are considered internal to an organization and are members of the Microsoft Entra organization. However, these users shouldn't be able to manage other users by, for example, creating and deleting users. Member users don't have the same restrictions that are typically placed on guest users.

## Guest users
Guest users have restricted Microsoft Entra organization permissions. When you invite someone to collaborate with your organization, you add them to your Microsoft Entra organization as a guest user. Then, you can either send an invitation email that contains a redemption link or send a direct link to an app you want to share. Guest users sign in with their own work, school, or social identities. By default, Microsoft Entra member users can invite guest users. Someone with the User Administrator role can disable this default.

Your organization might need to work with external partners. To collaborate with your organization, these partners often need to have a certain level of access to specific resources. For this sort of situation, it's a good idea to use guest user accounts. You'll then make sure partners have the right level of access to do their work, without having a higher level of access than they need.

## Add user accounts
You can add individual user accounts through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.

If you want to use the Azure CLI, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
# create a new user
az ad user create
```

This command creates a new user by using the Azure CLI.

For Azure PowerShell, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
# create a new user
New-MgUser
```

You can bulk create member users and guests accounts. The following example shows how to bulk invite guest users.

```powershell
$invitations = import-csv c:\bulkinvite\invitations.csv

$messageInfo = [Microsoft.Graph.PowerShell.Models.MicrosoftGraphInvitation]@{ `
   CustomizedMessageBody = "Hello. You are invited to the Contoso organization." }

foreach ($email in $invitations)
   {New-MgInvitation `
      -InviteRedirectUrl https://myapps.microsoft.com ` 
      -InvitedUserDisplayName $email.Name `
      -InvitedUserEmailAddress $email.InvitedUserEmailAddress `
      -InvitedUserMessageInfo $messageInfo `
      -SendInvitationMessage 
   }
```

You create the comma-separated values (CSV) file with the list of all the users you want to add. An invitation is sent to each user in that CSV file.

## Delete user accounts
You can also delete user accounts through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. In PowerShell, run the cmdlet `Remove-MgUser`. In the Azure CLI, run the cmdlet `az ad user delete`.

When you delete a user, the account remains in a suspended state for 30 days. During that 30-day window, the user account can be restored.

-----------------------------

## Manage app and resource access by using Microsoft Entra groups

You want to give the all developers within your organization the same access. You also want to manage who is part of the developers group and who isn't.

Microsoft Entra ID helps you to manage your cloud-based apps, on-premises apps, and resources by using your organization's groups. Your resources can be part of the Microsoft Entra organization, like permissions to manage objects through roles. Or your resources can be external to the organization, like software as a service (SaaS) apps, Azure services, SharePoint sites, and on-premises resources.

## Access management in Microsoft Entra ID
- Microsoft Entra roles: Use Microsoft Entra roles to manage Microsoft Entra ID-related resources like users, groups, billing, licensing, application registration, and more.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources: Use RBAC roles to manage access to Azure resources like virtual machines, SQL databases, or storage. For example, you could assign an RBAC role to a user to manage and delete SQL databases in a specific resource group or subscription.

## Access rights through single user or group assignment
Microsoft Entra ID helps you provide access rights to a single user or to an entire group of users. You can assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group. Access permissions range from full access to the ability to create or remove resources.

There are different ways you can assign access rights:

- Direct assignment: Assign a user the required access rights by directly assigning a role that has those access rights.
- Group assignment: Assign a group the required access rights, and members of the group will inherit those rights.
- Rule-based assignment: Use rules to determine a group membership based on user or device properties. For a user account or device's group membership to be valid, the user or device must meet the rules. If the rules aren't met, the user account or device's group membership is no longer valid. The rules can be simple. You can select prewritten rules or write your own advanced rules.

## Collaborate by using guest accounts and Microsoft Entra B2B

You want the external team to collaborate with the internal developer team in a process that's easy and secure. With Microsoft Entra business to business (B2B), you can add people from other companies to your Microsoft Entra tenant as guest users.

If your organization has multiple Microsoft Entra tenants, you may also want to use Microsoft Entra B2B to give a user in tenant A access to resources in tenant B. Each Microsoft Entra tenant is distinct and separate from other Microsoft Entra tenants and has its own representation of identities and app registrations.

## Guest user access in Microsoft Entra B2B
In any scenario where external users need temporary or restricted access to your organization's resources, give them guest user access. You can grant guest user access with the appropriate restrictions in place, then remove access when the work is done.

You can use the Azure portal to invite B2B collaboration users. Invite guest users to the Microsoft Entra organization, group, or application. After you invite a user, their account is added to Microsoft Entra ID as a guest account.

The guest can get the invitation through email, or you can share the invitation to an application by using a direct link. The guest then redeems their invitation to access the resources.

By default, users and administrators in Microsoft Entra ID can invite guest users, but the Global Administrator can limit or disable this ability.

## Collaborate with any partner by using their identities
If your organization has to manage the identities of each external guest user who belongs to a given partner organization, it faces increased responsibilities because it has to secure those identities. There's an increased workload to manage and administer those identities. You also have to sync accounts, manage the lifecycle of each account, and track each individual external account to meet your obligations. Your organization has to follow this procedure for every partner organization with which it wants to collaborate. Also, if something happens to those accounts, your organization is liable.

With Microsoft Entra B2B, you don't have to manage your external users' identities. The partner has the responsibility to manage its own identities. External users continue to use their current identities to collaborate with your organization.

For example, say you work with the external partner Giovanna Carvalho at Proseware. Her organization manages her identity as gcarvalho@proseware.com. You use that identity for the guest account in your organization's Microsoft Entra ID. After Giovanna redeems the guest account invitation, she uses the same identity (name and password) for the guest account as she does for her organization.


## Why use Microsoft Entra B2B instead of federation?
With Microsoft Entra B2B, you don't take on the responsibility of managing and authenticating the credentials and identities of partners. Your partners can collaborate with you even if they don't have an IT department. For example, you can collaborate with a contractor who only has a personal or business email address and no identity management solution managed by an IT department.

Giving access to external users is much easier than in a federation. You don't need an AD administrator to create and manage external user accounts. Any authorized user can invite other users. A line manager could, for example, invite external users to collaborate with their team. When collaboration is no longer needed, you can easily remove these external users.

A federation is more complex. A federation is where you have a trust established with another organization, or a collection of domains, for shared access to a set of resources. You might be using an on-premises identity provider and authorization service like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) that has an established trust with Microsoft Entra ID. To get access to resources, all users have to provide their credentials and successfully authenticate against the AD FS server. If you have someone trying to authenticate outside the internal network, you need to set up a web application proxy. 

-----------------------------------

# What is Microsoft Entra ID?

Though they once shared a similar name, Microsoft Entra ID is not a cloud version of Windows Server Active Directory. It's also not intended as a complete replacement for an on-premises Active Directory. Instead, if you're already using a Windows AD server, you can connect it to Microsoft Entra ID to extend your directory into Azure. This approach allows users to use the same credentials to access local and cloud-based resources.

A user can also use Microsoft Entra ID independently of Windows AD. Smaller companies can use Microsoft Entra ID as their only directory service to control access to their applications and SaaS products, such as Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Dropbox.

## Directories, subscriptions, and users
Microsoft offers several cloud-based offerings today, all of which can use Microsoft Entra ID to identify users and control access:

- Microsoft Azure
- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Intune
- Microsoft Dynamics 365
When a company or organization signs up to use one of these offerings, they're assigned a default directory, an instance of Microsoft Entra ID. This directory holds the users and groups that will have access to each of the services the company has purchased. You can refer to this default directory as a tenant. A tenant represents the organization and the default directory assigned to it.

A subscription in Azure is both a billing entity and a security boundary. Resources such as virtual machines, websites, and databases are associated with a single subscription. Each subscription also has a single account owner responsible for any charges incurred by resources in that subscription. If your organization wants a subscription billed to another account, you can transfer the subscription. A subscription is associated with a single Microsoft Entra directory. Multiple subscriptions can trust the same directory, but a subscription can only trust one directory.

## Create and manage users

Every user who needs access to Azure resources needs an Azure user account. Your user account contains all the information needed to authenticate you during the sign-in process. Once authenticated, Microsoft Entra ID builds an access token to authorize you, determine what resources you can access, and determine what you can do with those resources.

You can use the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard in the Azure portal to work with user objects. Keep in mind that you can only work with a single directory at a time, but you can use the Directory + Subscription pane to switch directories. The dashboard also has a Manage tenants button in the toolbar, which makes it easy to view all your directories and switch to another available directory.

## Create and manage groups

A Microsoft Entra group helps organize users, which makes it easier to manage permissions. Using groups lets the resource owner (or Microsoft Entra directory owner), assign a set of access permissions to all the group members instead of having to provide the rights one by one. Groups allow you to define a security boundary, then add and remove specific users to grant or deny access with a minimum amount of effort. Even better, Microsoft Entra ID supports the ability to define membership based on rules, such as what department a user works in or the job title they have.

Microsoft Entra ID allows you to define two different types of groups.

- Security groups: These are the most common, and are used to manage member and computer access to shared resources for a group of users. For example, you can create a security group for a specific security policy. By doing it this way, you can give a set of permissions to all the members at once instead of having to add permissions to each member individually. This option requires a Microsoft Entra administrator.

- Microsoft 365 groups: These groups provide collaboration opportunities by giving members access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint site, and more. This option also lets you give people outside of your organization access to the group. This option is available to users as well as admins.
